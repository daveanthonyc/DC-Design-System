# David Chiang's Freelancer Design System

This is an open source React/TypeScript design system which I intend to use to build websites as a freelancer but also allow others to build their own sites. The Storybook library has been added for easier inspection and testing of components and the link to it can be found here.

**However, this repo is mainly for the documenting of my findings on how to build production ready frontend design systems.**
